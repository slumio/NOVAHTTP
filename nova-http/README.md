## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Epoll-based Event Loop** â†’ Efficient async I/O with edge-triggered polling  
- **Zero-Copy File Serving** â†’ Uses `sendfile()` for optimal static content delivery  
- **HTTP/1.1 Compliance** â†’ Persistent connections & request pipelining  
- **TLS/SSL Integration** â†’ OpenSSL with modern cipher suites & ALPN support  
- **Thread Pool Architecture** â†’ Optimized worker model with work stealing  
- **Object Pooling** â†’ Memory-efficient connection & request lifecycle management  
- **Production Observability** â†’ Prometheus metrics, structured logging, health checks  
- **Security Hardening** â†’ Rate limiting, input validation, secure defaults  
- **Container Ready** â†’ Docker multi-stage builds & Kubernetes manifests
